# Twitter Sentiment Analysis NLP Model
This repository contains an NLP machine learning model for sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The model is designed to classify tweets as either positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the text.

## Dataset
The model has been trained on a publicly available Twitter sentiment analysis dataset, which consists of labeled tweets with corresponding sentiment labels. The dataset contains a balanced distribution of positive and negative tweets, enabling the model to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.

## Model Architecture
The sentiment analysis model is built using natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a combination of pre-processing steps, feature extraction methods, and classification algorithms to achieve accurate sentiment classification.

The model architecture consists of the following key components:

* Text pre-processing: Tokenization, stop word removal, CountVectorizer, and stemming/lemmatization.
* Feature extraction: Transforming text data into numerical features using techniques like bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.
* Classification algorithm: Training a classifier, such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, or support vector machines, to predict sentiment labels based on the extracted features.

## Usage
To use the sentiment analysis model, follow these steps:

* Preprocess the input tweet using the same pre-processing steps used during training (e.g., tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization).
* Extract features from the preprocessed tweet using the same feature extraction technique employed during training (e.g., bag-of-words, TF-IDF, word embeddings).
* Load the trained classification model.
* Feed the extracted features into the loaded model to obtain the predicted sentiment label.

## Training and Evaluation
The sentiment analysis model was trained on a labeled Twitter sentiment dataset with **`train tweet`** provided by the creators of the dataset. During training, various models and feature extraction techniques were evaluated and compared to select the best performing combination.

To reproduce the training process, refer to the twitter_sentiment_analysis_nlp.ipynb script in the repository. It contains the code to load the dataset, preprocess the text data, extract features, train the model, and save the trained model for future use.

The evaluation metrics for the model include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the model in predicting sentiment labels.
